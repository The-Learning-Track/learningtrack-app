Totoro Grid System by Rob Johnson http://robkellas.com

The grid system itself is just file 16_980grid.css, but I recommend you use reset.css and text.css taken directly from 960.gs. In fact you may want to make sure you have the latest version and download that from 960.gs.

Demo.css is just for the grid demo.

You can use the grid html in index.html and it should be clean and ready for your next project!
